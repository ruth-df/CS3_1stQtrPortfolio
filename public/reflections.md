# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. Variable declaration - Most of the syntax used in JavaScript is intuitive. Prior experience with variable declaration from CS1 and CS2 also allowed me to have proper exposure on how to correctly define variables.
2. Operators - Again, most of the syntax used in JavaScript is intuitive. Operators used in JavaScript are also quite the same as those used before in C++ during CS2.
3. Conditional Statements - This is not a new topic to me as it was taught to us back in CS1. The logic of conditional statements is very easy to understand.
# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. Loops - The logic is quite easy to understand and explain. My only difficulty is how to properly write this onto my code.
2. Functions - The logic of this is also quite easy to understand. My only difficulty with this is figuring out when I would need this in my code.
3. Number Objects - As simple as the logic of these syntax may be, it is a bit difficult for me to understand when I would use them. I'm having a bit of confusion with this in particular since it is a new concept to me.
# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
An ideal way to approach these problems would be to study and expose myself to scenarios when I would need to use such topics. Practical application always works best for me when it comes to having to understand things.
# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
## Effective:
1. Bonus Tasks - These gave students an opportunity to gain bonus points in case they are uncertain about their performance in the subject while also providing additional knowledge to the student.
2. Coding Exercises - As much as they are a hassle since it is another requirement on the list, these coding exercises are very useful since they are usually aligned with the current lessons and topics so far.
## Not effective
I don't think any of the activities we are being asked to do in CS3 are considered as not effective since the teacher provides sufficient materials for us students to use in studying and understanding the lesson.
